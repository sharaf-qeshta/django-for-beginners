1- install python
2- install django "pip install django"
3- creating django project by "django-admin startproject example ." or "django-admin startproject example"
  /* the difference between the two forms is the dotted one create one config file and the manage.py
   but the other create config/config and config/manage.py */

** i think the second form is better (without dot)
